## How does it work

The main purpose of this repository is to track my progress in learning the Spring framework from "Spring Boot: Up and
Running" by Mark Heckler. As I read the book, I am going to upload some code examples.

There are branches for each chapter of the book in which I had to write some code. The template of all programs is in
the main
branch.
